# Focus - YouTube

The purpose of this extension is to help people develop a more healthy relationship with YouTube. Often times people find themselves spending too much time than expected due to some menacing social engineering. One of the things that keeps users spending the most time on YouTube is the 'recommendation' feature where, based on historical data, YouTube recommends videos that the user is most likely to watch. Eliminating this feature helps users to spend time on exactly what they meant to do on YouTube.

Usage is very simple. Install the extension from here(?) and enjoy your improved ability to focus!
